**PROBLEMS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2025**
**HOME PAGE**
**--------------------------------------------------------**
**home page intro layout should have image to right of text**
**nav menu portfolio link text should say FULL PORTFOLIO**
**nav menu portfolio link should go to portfolio page**
**contact form is missing intro text and styles**

**DYNAMIC NAVIGATION**
**--------------------------------------------------------**
**{{PAGE_STYLES}} showing above header**
**header isn't fixed**
**the home list item is missing from the mobile menu**

**BREADCRUMBS**
**--------------------------------------------------------**
**breadcrumbs show {{BREADCRUMB_CATEGORY}} with a link to http://127.0.0.1:5501/src/pages/portfolio-pages/{{BREADCRUMB_CATEGORY_URL}}**
**page title is not visible against the background - need better contrast, maybe one of the greens?**

**PORTFOLIO PAGE**
**--------------------------------------------------------**
**I'm not sure why this div.page-header and its inner HTML exist**

<!-- <div class="page-header">
       <div class="wrapper">
         <h1 class="page-header__title">Full Portfolio | I Knit The Web</h1>
         <p class="page-header__subtitle">Complete collection of web development projects</p>
       </div>
</div> -->

**div.wrapper inside div.wrapper just inside #main-content is redundant and creates extra padding at the sides of the viewport**
**intro text is old version I think - either way I want to improve at least the first sentence. should "modern web development practices" be changed to "modern front end development practices" or would that be difficult for non-coders to understand? I'm using the site to offer my services as a free-lance developer to small businesses and individuals, not to get hired by a firm.**

**CALCULATOR PAGE**
**--------------------------------------------------------**
**needs space around the calculator above and below**
**needs js to make it work or I need to change the text of the subtitle**
