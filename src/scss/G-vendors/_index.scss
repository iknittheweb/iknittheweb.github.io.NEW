//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//* VENDORS: INDEX PARTIAL
//*
//* Use this file to forward all vendor partials (bootstrap, plugin-name, etc.).
//* Only @forward statements should be in this file.
//* Do NOT put any CSS rules, selectors, or variable/mixin definitions here.
//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//& THE /VENDORS FOLDER
//* The /vendors folder includes third-party CSS files or frameworks that you might be using, such as Bootstrap or other CSS libraries.

//& Why It’s Important:
//* Keeping vendor styles separate ensures that third-party code doesn’t get mixed up with your custom styles, making it easier to update or remove libraries as needed.

@forward 'bootstrap';
@forward 'plugin-name';
