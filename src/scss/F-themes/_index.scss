//* THEMES: INDEX PARTIAL
//*
//* Use this file to forward all theme partials (light-theme, dark-theme, etc.).
//* Only @forward statements should be in this file.
//* Do NOT put any CSS rules, selectors, or variable/mixin definitions here.
//* ------------------------------------------------------------
//& THE /THEMES FOLDER
//* Page-specific styles are kept separate from global styles, which helps avoid unnecessary bloat in your CSS and makes it easier to locate and modify page-specific styles.

//& Why Itâ€™s Important:
//* Separating theme styles allows for easy toggling between different visual modes, improving the user experience with minimal effort.

@forward 'light-theme';
@forward 'dark-theme';
