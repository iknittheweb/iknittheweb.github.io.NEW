            <p>I have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen long, and eight-feet posts, with a
                garret and a closet, a large window on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace
                opposite.</p>
            <p>The exact cost of my house, paying the usual price for such materials as I used, but not counting the work, all
                of which was done by myself, was as follows; and I give the details because very few are able to tell exactly
                what their houses cost, and fewer still, if any, the separate cost of the various materials which compose them:â€”
            </p>

            <dl class="materials">
                <dt>Boards</dt>
                <dd>$ 8.03Â½, mostly shanty boards</dd>
                
                <dt>Refuse shingles for roof sides</dt>
                <dd>$ 4.00</dd>
                
                <dt>Laths</dt>
                <dd>$ 1.25</dd>
                
                <dt>Two second-hand windows with glass</dt>
                <dd>$ 2.43</dd>
                
                <dt>One thousand old brick</dt>
                <dd>$4.00</dd>
                
                <dt>Two casks of lime</dt>

                <dt>Hair</dt>
                <dd>$0.31</dd>
                
                <dt>Mantle-tree iron</dt>
                <dd>$0.15</dd>

                <dt>Hinges and screws</dt>
                <dd>$0.14</dd>

                <p>I carried a good part on my back. In all, $28.12Â½</p>
            </dl>

            <p>These are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand, which I claimed by squatterâ€™s right. I have
                also a
                small wood-shed adjoining, made chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.</p>

            <p>I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon
                as
                it pleases me as much and will cost me no more than my present one.</p>
